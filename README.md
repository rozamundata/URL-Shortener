# URL-Shortener
Takes a long URL as input and generates a shortened URL using a simple hashing algorithm. It can be used to create concise and shareable links.

This code uses the MD5 hashing algorithm to generate a hash of the long URL and takes the first 8 characters of the hash as the shortened URL. You can customize it further based on your requirements, such as using a different hash algorithm or storing the mappings of long URLs and their shortened counterparts in a database.
